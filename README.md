# The Implementation and Analysis of Prim, Naive Kruskal and Efficient Kruskal's Algorithms

# Abstract:

Research Focus: Comparison of Prim, Naive Kruskal’s and Efficient Kruskal algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree(MST) problems.

This report has scrutinized the implementation and analysis of three Minimum Spanning Tree finders which are Prim algorithm implemented with Heap, Naive Kruskal algorithm with O(m.n) complexity, and Efficient Kruskal algorithm based on Union-Find. The data set consists of 68 randomly generated graphs, ranging in the size of vertices from 10 to 100,000.

The reader of the paper can expect to answer following questions: \
• What are the execution times, the measured times with the asymptotic complexity, and the weight of the MST obtained by these three algorithms? \
• How do the algorithms behave with respect to the various instances? \
• Is there any algorithm that is always better than the others? \
• Which is the most efficient algorithm over the three of them? 

The final inferences to answer previously stated questions have been made by implementing and testing Prim, Naive Kruskal, and Efficient Kruskal algorithms on the same dataset by using Python as a programming language and using Google Colab as an environment.
